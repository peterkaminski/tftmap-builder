# TftMap Builder

TftMap Builder reads and parses People pages, to be able to write Tool and Practice pages in the Tools for Thought map.

It is still under development and is not yet complete.

## Running

Specify the directory where the map Markdown files are using `-d`.

Example:

```shell
./tftmap-builder.py -d ~/Documents/GitHub/tftmap/map
```

The current version parses People pages and outputs various collated information for debug and development.
